 * own hosted/redirect surface — e.g. Stripe Checkout, the Razorpay popup),
 * because not every gateway exposes a primitive the host can wrap in its own
 * card fields. A driver that does (Stripe, via a PaymentIntent) implements this
 * so the application can collect card details in its own UI while card data
 * still goes straight to the gateway — never the host server.
 *
 * The returned {@see PaymentSession} carries the client secret the browser
 * confirms against; verification of the result still goes through
 * {@see PaymentGateway::capturePayment()}.
