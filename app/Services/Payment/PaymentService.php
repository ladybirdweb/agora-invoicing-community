/**
 * Generalized payment processing for the application.

 * The single, domain-agnostic bridge between the dependency-pure payment package
 * ({@see Payment}) and the application. It knows only how to wire the
 * configured gateways from the {@see ApiKey} model and drive them with plain
 * package value objects — it knows nothing about invoices, open-payment orders,
 * the authenticated user, or order fulfilment.
 *
 * Each caller owns its own domain: it builds a {@see PaymentRequest} for its
 * entity, calls {@see start()} / {@see capture()} / {@see verifyWebhook()}, and
 * decides what a verified payment means for it (e.g. invoice fulfilment lives in
 * {@see PaymentController}). This keeps the service
 * reusable across every payment surface — invoices, open payments, and beyond.
