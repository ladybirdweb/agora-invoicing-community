/**
 * Contract every payment gateway driver implements.
 *
 * Drivers in this package are deliberately application-agnostic: they are
 * constructed with their own credentials, take a plain {@see PaymentRequest}
 * value object, and return plain value objects ({@see PaymentSession},
 * {@see PaymentResult}). They depend only on their vendor SDK and PHP — never
 * on the host application's models, config, session or auth — so the package
 * can be lifted out and reused on its own.
 *
 * Lifecycle (the lowest common denominator of modern gateways):
 *   createPayment()    — open a payment and hand the client what its SDK needs.
 *   capturePayment()   — verify a client callback against the gateway and report
 *                        whether money was captured.
 *   refundPayment()    — refund a captured payment, fully or partially.
 *   getPaymentStatus() — read a payment's current status from the gateway.
 *   verifyWebhook()    — authenticate a raw webhook body against its signature.
 *
 * Every method that talks to the gateway throws a {@see PaymentException}
 * on failure (so "no exception" means success); only verifyWebhook returns a
 * plain bool rather than throwing.
