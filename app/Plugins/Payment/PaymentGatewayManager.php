/**
 * A tiny registry that resolves gateway drivers by name.
 *
 * It is intentionally credential-free: the consumer registers a factory closure
 * for each gateway it has configured, and the factory supplies the credentials.
 * This keeps the manager — and the whole package — independent of where
 * credentials come from (env, a database, a vault, hard-coded in a test).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   $gateways = (new PaymentGatewayManager)
 *       ->register('Stripe',   fn () => new StripeGateway($secret, $publishable))
 *       ->register('Razorpay', fn () => new RazorpayGateway($key, $keySecret));
 *
 *   $gateways->gateway('Stripe')->createPayment($request);
 *
 * Lookups are case-insensitive ("stripe" === "Stripe"); driver instances are
 * memoised so repeated gateway() calls reuse the same object.
