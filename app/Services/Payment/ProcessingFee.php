/**
 * Processing fee — the single source of truth for payment-gateway fees.
 *
 * A processing fee is a merchant surcharge to recover gateway costs: a single
 * percentage per gateway (currency-independent), set by the admin and charged
 * ON TOP of the order total, so the customer pays it and the merchant nets the
 * full amount.
 *
 * The fee lives in the gateway's own table (e.g. `stripe`, `razorpay`) — the
 * only thing that table is used for, since currency *support* is driven by the
 * plugin config, not these rows. It is stored uniformly across the rows so any
 * single read is authoritative.
